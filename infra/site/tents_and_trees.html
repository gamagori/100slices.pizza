I've been playing a fun mobile game called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frozax.tentsandtrees">"Tents and Trees Puzzles"</a>. It's sort of like sudoku, and it has a similar appeal - following a set of simple rules, fill in the spaces with the correct value. These are the rules, paraphrased from the tutorial:
<br>
<table>
	<tr><td>
	1) Your goal is to place one tent next to each tree. 
	</tr></td>
	<tr><td>
	  2) All spaces that don't have a tent or a tree should have grass. 
	</tr></td>
	<tr><td>
	3) Each tent must be directly adjacent to a tree (no diagonals). 
	</tr></td>
	<tr><td>
	4) Tents cannot touch each other (not even diagonally).
	</tr></td>
	<tr><td>
</table>
<br>
It's dead simple and, if you enjoy games like sudoku, a lot of fun. Here is level one, both as it begins, and mostly solved:

<br><br>
The puzzles really lend themselves to algorithmic thinking. For example, once
you've determined where to place a tent, you can follow this algorithm to make
sure you fill up as many grassy spaces as possible:
<br>
<table>
	<tr><td>
	1) Place a tent.
	</tr></td>
	<tr><td>
	2) Place grass in every space around the tent (including diagonals)
	</tr></td>
	<tr><td>
	3) If the number of tents in the row is equal to the row hint,
		fill the rest of the row up with grass.
	</tr></td>
	<tr><td>
	4) If the number of tents in the column is equal to the column hint,
		fill the rest of the column up with grass. 
	</tr></td>
</table>
<br>
Maybe you can see where this is going. I've had nothing better to do this 
weekend, so I took this way too far and implemented a "Tents and Trees Solver",
then measured the algorithms for efficiency. 
<br>
<br>
First, let's store a level in memory. I'm going to do a super simple encoding -
integers for the hints, spaces for empty spaces, and "T" for the trees. As the
game progresses, we can use "C" for the campsites and "G" for grass. 
<br>
<br>
A 2D array is an okay representation. It's certainly intuitive, and it makes
interacting with rows very easy. There is one obvious shortcoming - how do I
interact with columns? - but I can deal with that later.
Here's what level one looks like:
<br>
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;level_one = [<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[" ", "2", "0", "1", "1", "1"],<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;["1", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "],<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;["1", " ", "T", " ", "T", " "],<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;["0", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "],<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;["2", "T", "T", " ", " ", " "],<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;["1", " ", " ", " ", " ", "T"]<br>
&emsp;&emsp;]<br>
<br>

I'm going to write some test code, to define the way that I want to interact
with a level in code, then see if I can code to match that. Something like:

<br>
&emsp;&emsp;l1 = level(level_one)<br>

<br>
&emsp;&emsp;for row in l1.rows:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if row.hint == "0":<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;grassify(row)<br>

<br>
&emsp;&emsp;for tree in l1.trees:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if tree.has_tent():<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;continue<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;if tree.count_free_spaces() == 1:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;l1.place_tent(tree.get_free_spaces())<br>
<br>
I've implemented some of those functions <a href="https://github.com/gamagori/tnt_algos/commit/37908418e6271671d6b8932b97d6b7f1a05c419d">here</a>, but I ran into some complications. Namely:
<table>
	<tr><td>
	1) Using a 2D array makes representing columns unintuitive.
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
	2) Trees need to know information about the level, but I don't want to have a super leaky abstraction.
	</td></tr>
</table>

<br>
I will move ceaselessly forward and take on these complications - later, though. The weekend is over. For now, check out the before and after of that 'grassify' function:
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('1', [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '])
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('1', [' ', 'T', ' ', 'T', ' '])
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('0', [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '])
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('2', ['T', 'T', ' ', ' ', ' '])
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('1', [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'T'])
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('1', [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '])
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('1', [' ', 'T', ' ', 'T', ' '])
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('0', ['G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G'])
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('2', ['T', 'T', ' ', ' ', ' '])
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;('1', [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'T'])

<br>
<br>
