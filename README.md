This is the website called 100slices.pizza. 

My name is Grant Gordon - I'm the operator of this website. I'm happy to have you here!

I use this website to post my thoughts on systems administration, electrical engineering, and pizza.

The reason I'm doing this on the public Internet (rather than in a private notebook), is that I'd like to solicit feedback from whoever cares enough to read. 

Here are some posts that you might like to read:
