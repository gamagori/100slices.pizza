# I Fixed My Voltmeter!
## Well, I fixed one of the alligator-clip leads. 
### I'm also responsible for breaking it.
#### I didn't read the instructions very well. 

My voltmeter came with a couple of attachable alligator clips. I've been using them to clip on to quarter-inch cable sockets, to get hands-free voltage and frequency readings while I fiddle with other things or take notes. 

Initially, I didn't realize that the voltmeter leads had removeable plastic sheaths. I failed to remove these sheaths before pushing on the alligator clips, and damaged one of the alligator clips. Pushing the bulky sheath into the alligator clip housing expanded the housing, so that it would no longer hold a lead. 

I removed the alligator clip from it's rubber sleeve, and used pliers compress the housing back into place - more or less. 

It's a simple fix, but it's nice to be able to fix your own tools.
