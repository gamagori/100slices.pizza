## I Fixed My Voltmeter!
### Well, I fixed one of the alligator-clip leads. 
#### I'm also responsible for breaking it, because I didn't read the instructions. 

My voltmeter came with a couple of attachable alligator clips. I've been using them to clip on to the quarter-inch cable sockets, to get hands-free voltage and frequency readings while I fiddle with other things or take notes. 

Initially, I didn't realize that the voltmeter leads had removeable plastic sheaths. I didn't remove these before pushing on the alligator clips, and damaged one of the alligator clips by pushing the bulky sheath into the alligator clip housing.

I removed the alligator clip from it's rubber sleeve, and used pliers compress the housing back into place - more or less. 

It's a simple fix, but it's nice to be able to fix your own tools.
