# Mellow Yellow

I'm taking apart a distortion pedal that I own. I bought it at a garage sale in Minneapolis for $20, no tax.
The case is bright yellow (hence the "Yellow") and it adds indiscriminate, high-frequency distortion to anything that passes through it (hence the "Mellow" - nobody in the band was a fan).

The innards are hand-soldered and mostly intact, and there's probably fewer than two dozen wires altogether. It seems like a great place to start learning how circuits work.
