# Mello Yello

I'm taking apart a distortion pedal that I own. I bought it at a garage sale in Minneapolis for $20, no tax.
The case is bright yellow (hence the "Yello") and it adds scratchy, high-frequency distortion to anything that passes through it (hence the "Mello" - nobody in our 5-piece folk rock band was a fan).

The innards are hand-soldered and mostly intact, and there's probably fewer than two dozen wires altogether. It seems like a great place to start learning how circuits work.

Who knows how circuits work? Not me! I watched some videos to get my head on straight:
 - Pluralsight has [a decent introduction](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/electronics-fundamentals) to the fundamentals. 
 - Jeremy Blum has an excellent introduction to Eagle, a computer-aided design tool introduced in the Pluralsight course:
   - [Schematic Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AXwjZoyNno)
   - [Printed Circuit Board Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCTs0mNXY24)
 - Khan Academy has [a much more thorough introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-circuit-analysis-topic) to electrical engineering concepts. 

I took apart the pedal, and got a sense of how everything was connected. I spent a day trying to draw a good circuit
diagram of the thing. It took a few tries, and I'm still not sure what some of the components are, but at least I've
got things sketched out on paper. Take a look [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/sHGTi8P). 

At the moment, I'm working through the Khan Academy videos to better understand how to work out the total resistance
in the circuit. I'll need to do that, and identify a couple of mystery components (which look like resistors, but that
doesn't make electrical sense) before I'm able to figure out the whole circuit. 

Then, I'll be able to:
 - Figure out why the pedal makes the noises it does.
 - Put the whole thing into Eagle. 
 - Finish the project? I'm not sure what "done" looks like yet - perhaps I will:
   - Order and solder my own board through Eagle, and see if it sounds the same. 
   - De-solder and re-solder the whole circuit, to make sure I understand it.
   - Solder additional components on, to change the noise.
